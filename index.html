								</a></h2>
									<p>Its a regressive problem.Here XGB Regressor is used for predictions.

										XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for various tasks, including regression problems like house price prediction. XGBoost Regressor is a specific implementation of XGBoost tailored for regression tasks. Here's a step-by-step description of how to use XGBoost Regressor for house price prediction:
										
										The problem of predicting house prices is typically considered a regression problem in machine learning. Regression is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict a continuous numeric value, such as the price of a house, based on input features like the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc.

In the context of house price prediction, you would have a dataset that includes information about various houses (features) and their corresponding sale prices (target variable). The machine learning model is trained on this data to learn a mapping from the input features to the output price. Once trained, the model can then be used to make price predictions for new, unseen houses based on their features.

Regression models for house price prediction can be based on various algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks, and more, depending on the complexity of the problem and the quality of the data. The choice of model and preprocessing techniques will depend on the specific requirements and characteristics of the dataset.

									<p>In this project we predict a person is diseased or not.<br />
										Problem Description:

										The goal of this project is to predict the binary output.Whether the patient has heart disease or not.Today, heart failure diseases affect more people worldwide than other autoimmune conditions.
										
										It is well known that the libraries available in Python for data loading, management, and building models, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn, help build robust data science applications. However, when dealing with medical data in data science, data privacy and protection are important parameters that cannot be ignored.With Python programming language, cybersecurity professionals can efficiently accomplish these aspects in healthcare projects. Beyond data science, Python is also widely used for decoding and sending packets, network scanning, accessing servers, analyzing web traffic, and port scanning.
										
										Best Machine learning approaches for Heart disease prediction are:<br />
										
										1.Logistic Regression
										
										2.Random Forest
										
										3.Decision Tree
										
										4.K-Nearest Neighbours
										
										5.Support Vector Machine
										
										6.ADA boost classifier.
										
										By performing this 6 techniques we will choose the best model for predict Heart Disease.</p>

									<p>Problem Description:
										checking the person is o2 saturated or not
										
										Predicting whether a person is oxygen (O2) saturated or not using machine learning can be approached as a binary classification problem. In this context, you want to classify individuals into two categories: "oxygen-saturated" and "not oxygen-saturated."
										The goal of this project is to predict the binary output.Whether the patient has disease or not.

									<p>Road accident survey visualization done by power bi.

										Creating a road accident analysis visualization in Power BI involves using various charts and graphs to gain insights into accident data. Below is a description of how you can visualize road accident data effectively:<br />
									1) Geographic Distribution 2) Accident Type 3) Road Type 4) Accident Severity 5) Vehicle Type 6) Weather Condition <br />
									Ensure that your Power BI dashboard is interactive, allowing users to filter data by location, time, accident type, and other relevant factors. Additionally, provide clear and concise tooltips for each visualization to aid in data interpretation. This road accident analysis dashboard can assist transportation authorities, law enforcement agencies, and policymakers in identifying accident patterns, improving road safety measures, and making data-driven decisions to reduce accidents and their severity. </p>

									<p>This is a dashboard created using tableau.

										Creating a dashboard visualization for San Francisco International Airport (SFO) using Tableau can provide valuable insights into airport operations, passenger trends, and performance metrics. Below, I'll describe the key elements and visualizations you might include in such a dashboard:<br />
										<br />Airport Overview:
Map Visualization: Display the airport layout with terminal locations, runways, and other important infrastructure. Use pins or labels to mark key areas.

<br />Passenger Statistics:
Line Chart: Show the trend in passenger numbers over time, with filters for different types of passengers (domestic, international). KPI Cards: Display the current total passenger count, average daily passengers, and year-over-year growth rate.

<br />Flight Information:
Bar Chart: Visualize the number of daily flights departing and arriving, categorized by airlines. Donut Chart: Display flight delays and cancellations as a percentage of total flights.
	<br />	Ensure that your Tableau dashboard is interactive, allowing users to filter data by date, airline, terminal, and other relevant factors. Additionally, provide clear and concise tooltips for each visualization to aid in data interpretation. This SFO dashboard can serve as a valuable tool for airport authorities, airlines, and passengers to monitor and improve airport operations and services.								</p>
